# Overview
This is a simple project I designed in the Kotlin
language with the goal of improving my versatility 
across different programming languages. 
The program is a version of the game hangman. The 
player guesses a letter that they think the word may
contain, and they do so until the complete word is
revealed to them. If the player guesses incorrectly,
a body part is added to hangman. If the hangman is
complete, the game is over.

# Development Environment
I developed this program in the Kotlin language and used
the Kotlin statndard library. I am very interested in developing apps for android
and wanted to become more acquainted with the languages
used to develop apps. I chose to use the IntelliJ IDE
because of templates and tools it provides for Kotlin.

# Future Work
1. Add ability to guess the entire word at once
2. Make it so the player can't guess the same letter twice
3. Add a timed mode
